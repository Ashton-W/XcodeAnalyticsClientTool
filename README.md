# Xcode Analytics Client Tool

Trying to create a CLI tool for Xcode's [`DVTAnalyticsClient.framework`](https://github.com/zolomatok/Xcode6-RuntimeHeaders/tree/master/DVTAnalyticsClient), the framework that powers the [Crashes Organizer](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/recipes/xcode_help-crashes_organizer/AboutCrashesOrganizer/AboutCrashesOrganizer.html).


This is currently pretty useless without figuring out how to do the authentication with iTunes Connect...
